title: "Links - Top Ruby Sites"
---
Ruby is an incredible language that can really open your eyes (especially if you come from the Microsoft world).  When ever I tell people I am learning Ruby and using it for future projects I get a "huh?", so here are a couple of my favorite Ruby sites that might help:

<a href="http://rubyinside.com/" title="Ruby Inside">Ruby Inside</a> - The top site to find new articles and information about Ruby and Ruby related sites.  Updated through out the day.
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/" title="O'Reilly Ruby Blog">O'Reilly Ruby Blog</a> - Great articles and how-to's on here.
<a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/" title="Try Ruby!">Try Ruby!</a> - An online parser that allows you to check out exactly what Ruby is all about.  Very cool.  They have a couple tutorials that will walk you through some things to try.  You will be amazed!
<a href="http://rubyquiz.com/" title="Ruby Quiz">Ruby Quiz</a> - I haven't enter one of these weekly contests yet...but I plan to this year.  They have lots of great challenges (some of which are very hard, but there is some easy ones too) listed along with all entered solutions so it is a great way to learn Ruby.
<a href="http://rubycorner.com/" title="Ruby Corner">Ruby Corner</a> - Aggregator of Ruby blogs....
<a href="http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/index.html" title="Poigant Guide to Ruby">Poigant Guide to Ruby</a> - There is some interesting folks in the Ruby and Rails communities, but I would say the auther of this series takes the cake.  He goes by 'why' and you will have to check it out cause it is hard to describe.  Can't promise you will learn Ruby from it unless you like comic books...but it will bring a smile to your face just thinking if all documentation was this fun to read.
