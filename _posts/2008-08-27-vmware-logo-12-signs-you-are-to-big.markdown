title: VMware Logo - 12 Signs You Are Too Big
---

I was downloading the VMware player today and noticed this [agreement](http://www.vmware.com/help/usage.html) just to download the logo to link back to their site.  How does stuff like this happen?

* You may only display the VMware Player icon on your Web site as designated herein, and not in any other manner. It is your responsibility to ensure that the link is always an active link to the VMware Player product page or the VMware Player download page or such other successor VMware website. 
* The VMware Player icon must appear by itself on your web page and in accordance with the minimum spacing (the height of the Web icon) between each side of the icon. 
* You may not alter the VMware Player icon in any manner, including, but not limited to, size, proportions, colors, elements or otherwise distort its perspective or appearance. 
* You may not link to vmware.com from a Web site that is obscene or pornographic, or disparaging, defamatory, or libelous to VMware or any of its products. 
* Your use may not directly or indirectly imply VMware's sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your product or service or present misleading information about VMware products or services. 
* Your use may not infringe any VMware intellectual property or other rights, may not violate any state or federal laws, and must comply with international IP laws. 
* You may not frame VMware content. 
* You may link to, but may not replicate, VMware content. 
* Your reference to VMware, its products, and its Web site must comply with the general trademark guidelines as specified in the VMware Branding Guidelines.

* These guidelines do not grant permission to use any other VMware logos or trademarks. 
* VMware reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate or modify your permission to display the VMware Player icon at any time.
