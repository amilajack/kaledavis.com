title: Newsletters Newsletters Newsletters. Oh My!
---

So here is my curated list of (mostly) curated newsletters. I've enjoyed all of these, and if you're subscribed to [Hacker Newsletter](http://hackernewsletter.com) I think you'll find many of these useful as well. I will update this list as I discover others.

## Favorites
* [Now I Know](http://nowiknow.com) is one I've mentioned several times before. Dan Lewis does an awesome job of coming up with interesting content every single day. If you're not one of the 100,000+ people already subscribed, you should check it out.
* Dave Pell's [NextDraft](http://nextdraft.com) seems to be a favorite for many. He covers a range of topics every weekday, and does so with enough humor to make news actually fun to read.
* [Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com) is a paid newsletter, so that makes it different than all the others listed here. However, if you do anything Ruby related I don't think this one is even optional - it is that good. It would be great to see this much passion poured into other topics. Check out an [article](https://practicingruby.com/articles/improving-legacy-systems?u=8d98bee1e9) to see what I mean.
* Each day, a random subscriber from [The List Serve](http://thelistserve.com/) is allowed to send out whatever they want to the 25k subscribers. To answer what you'r e thinking - yes, it provides for some crazy talk, but the great reads easy make up for it. I love ideas like this!
* [Links I Love](http://www.legalnomads.com/2012/03/links-i-loved.html) is a monthly newsletter that you'll wish was weekly. You can sign-up [here](http://forms.aweber.com/form/71/876507671.htm). Jodi does a great job curating articles that you won't find elsewhere.
* [Uncommon](https://uncommon.cc/story) asks when was the last time you stopped amidst a sea of 'likes'? It is something totally different and one that I think you'll enjoy.
* Scott Hanselman's [Newsletter of Wonderful Things](http://www.hanselman.com/newsletter/), which is like Hacker Newsletter minus Hacker News.
* [Brain Pickings](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/newsletter/) is probably one of the better known curated newsletters. Like 'Now I Know', you're always going to learn something new each week with this one.
* [Longreads](http://longreads.com/) - five great looooooooooong reads every week. A great and simple design make is even better (and gives you more time to read them).

## Startup
* [Term Sheet](http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&aid=2087267012&n=1) - probably one of the ugliest sign-up forms ever, but Dan Primack of Fortune does a great job covering all the VC, IPO, and exit deals going on.
