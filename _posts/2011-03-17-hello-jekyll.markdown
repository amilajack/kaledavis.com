I finally finished what I had wanted to do several years ago when I first read about [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a ruby static site generator created by Tom Preston-Werner (Cofounder of GitHub). The delay was mainly from just not using my site, but then I realized that was probably because it was such a pain to post something on my old WordPress site.

So here it is with a new design and no comments. I'm keeping everything simple and really focusing on just content this time around. I'm not even importing over all my previous posts, but rather just the few that still get some traffic as of today.

It is so nice to be in Vim creating content. I found a nice [plugin](https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim) that works great for creating new posts and publishing. If you have a bigger WordPress site I would highly recommend Paul Stamatiou's [how to migrate from WordPress to Jekyll](http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll).
