Attending the <a title="SharePoint Connections 2007" href="http://www.devconnections.com/shows/SP2007SP/default.asp?s=91">SharePoint Connections</a> event this week in Orlando.  So far it has been mixed, with a couple great sessions along with some that missed the mark.  Looking forward to today's breakout sessions and hopefully I will have more to post about afterwards.

The keynote meeting Sunday night was a mixed bag.  <a title="Scott Guthrie" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> started it off right and went into some of the new ASP.NET developments like <a title="Orcas" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx">Orcas</a>, <a title="LINQ" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/XML/linqproject/default.aspx">LINQ</a>, and <a title="WPF/E" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/wpfe/">WPF/E</a>. A couple cool demos were given and I can't wait to work with those technologies more.  Just from Scott's blog you can tell how much passion he has for what he does and it showed during his talk.

The rest of the keynote was disappointing.  A program manager from SQL was next and while it an okay presentation, it wasn't geared for everyone. Did see a couple things like the <a title="SQL Performance Dashboard" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1d3a4a0d-7e0c-4730-8204-e419218c1efc">SQL Performance Dashboard</a> that I didn't know about and will have to check out more.

The last presenter of the night was suppose to be <a title="Lawrence Liu" href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/blogs/lliu/default.aspx">Lawrence Liu</a>, but his flight was delayed so <a title="Stacy Draper" href="http://www.wildwires.com/Blog/">Stacy Draper</a> stepped in at the last minute.  I don't think I would be able to do any better of a job in front of that many people, but his overview of WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 was really poor.  If anyone was hoping to get excited about SharePoint during the keynote they had to be disappointed.
