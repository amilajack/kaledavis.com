  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>
  	During the day I work with Microsoft technologies like ASP.NET and SharePoint, but enjoy Ruby hacking the most and do that on the side with my <a href="http://simplerise.com">Simplerise</a> freelance business. No matter what I'm doing though, I have a great passion for learning and coming up with creative ideas. The idea part drives my wonderful wife nuts, but she keeps loving me anyhow.

  <p>I love hearing from people. You can contact me at kale {at} simplerise {dot} com.</p>

  <h3>Site</h3>
