  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>I come from the world of Microsoft, but enjoy good Ruby hacking the most. I obviously need to finish this page one day, but it won't be today. I started <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a> last summer. Please check it out if you like Hacker News or just tech in general. You can contact me at kale {at} simplerise {dot} com.</p>
<h3>Site</h3>
<p>This site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. It doesn't get any better than that. I use <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=af49e9960c8cc514796a70c12667ac13cf1e385d">Linode</a> to host everything.
